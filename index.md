# About me

I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in College of Engineering, Pune(COEP) majoring in Electronics & Telecommunications engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering. Apart from being a general tinkerer of electronic gadgets, playing with integrated circuits and designing PCBs for small time embedded projects, I have a deep love for programming with an eye for machine learning and computer vision. After having spent 2 years of my undergrad working on antenna design and micro-controller and IOT based projects, I am currently trying my hands at research. My research aspirations surfaced from a project that I completed in my pre-final year - Human posture recognition using artificial neural networks - that eventually culminated into a conference paper which I will be presenting this December(2018). 

I have a penchant for deep neural networks and their applications in the domain of signal and image processing. I savour the mathematical nuances of neural networks - stochastic gradient descent & back-propagation - along with interpreting how tweaking the hyper-parameters mold the network. Over time, my interests have gravitated towards efficient implementations of deep neural networks on platforms like FPGAs that exploit the inherent parallelism especially in convolutional neural networks. Given the rapid adaptation of deep learning techniques and the availability of FPGAs on cloud, such efficient(both in power consumption and execution speed) implementations for deep learning would prove to be consequential.

Another area that is of deep interest to me is that of information theory. I find this subject to be extremely challenging and intriguing at the same time. Further, the concepts that form the basis of this subject like those of entropy have helped me develop an intuitive understanding of the motivation behind using the log-likelihood loss function that is used in a myriad of machine learning algorithms. I have implemented the LZW universal coding compression algorithm as a python package [here](https://github.com/pytholic97/LZW-Text-File-Compression).
